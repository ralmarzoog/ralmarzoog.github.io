                I graduated <span class="emph italicized">summa cum laude</span> from <span class="emph">Tufts University</span> in <span class="emph">2016</span> with a <span class="emph">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</span>. I was inducted into <span class="emph">Phi Beta Kappa</span> during my junior year at Tufts. My coursework at Tufts included classes such as Graphics, Internet-scale Distributed Systems, Wearable Devices, Concurrent Programming, Computer Security, Machine Learning, Computation Theory, Web Programming, Data Visualization, Algorithms, Discrete Math, Programming Languages, Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming, Data Structures, and Calculus. I studied abroad in the French Alps for 6 weeks during the summer of 2013 through <span class="emph">Tufts-in-Talloires</span> as a <span class="emph">MacJannet Scholar</span>.

                <p>
                As of <span class="emph">September 2016</span>, I'm part of <span class="emph">Google</span>'s Engineering Residency program in <span class="emph">NYC</span>.

                <p>
                From <span class="emph">June to August of 2015</span>, the summer after my junior year at Tufts, I worked as a <span class="emph">Software Engineer Intern</span> at <span class="emph">Microsoft</span> in <span class="emph">Cambridge, MA</span>. I was part of the Foundry, so I worked on a team of interns to an application from the ground up. I collaborated with a program manager intern, a UI/UX designer intern, and 3 other developer interns to design and implement a cross-platform application for Android and iOS (with a focus on Android) using Xamarin and C#.

                <p>
                From <span class="emph">June to December of 2014</span>, I worked as a <span class="emph">Web Developer Intern</span> at a start-up called <span class="emph">TurningArt</span>. TurningArt leases artwork to businesses to provide a rotating selection of pieces, ensuring that the space never gets old. As one of two members on the tech team, I was able ot make meaningful contributions to TurningArt's Rails-based website, creating features for both customers and employees. I designed and programmed a highly-requested feature used to optionally organize the artwork displayed on over 1,000 artists' public profiles into portfolios. I created a system that allowed administrators to easily identify, document, and find artwork that can be printed at large sizes, ultimately increasing the efficiency of the curation process. I also overhauled the Curator Dashboard, which curators used to recommend artwork to businesses, to increase the rate at which the curators are able to close deals. Technologies I worked with included Ruby-on-Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, jQuery. I also used RSpec and Capybara for Test Driven Development.
