                        EcoSym is a simulation of a marine ecosystem. The ecosystem contains marine organisms and simulates the relationships between these organisms, as well as a few natural processes that occur in such ecosystems. EcoSym currently simulates a select few marine organisms, but the design allows potential to quickly add more. The size of the body of water and number of organisms is only limited by the thread limit on the machine running the simulation. Features include predator-prey relationships, reproduction, aging and maturity, movement, and starvation.
