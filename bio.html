			Born and raised in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, I moved to the suburbs of Portland, Oregon when I was 16 and finished my last two years of high school there. I'm now a junior at Tufts University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Colonialism Studies.

			My interests outside of programming and colonialism studies include drawing, reading, eating more chocolate than seems humanly possible, and binge-watching TV shows.
